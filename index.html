                    <p class="card-text ml-1">Hi! My name is Dazrin Tioseco. I am 26 years old and currently residing in Vancouver, BC. I am the eldest of two younger brothers, and own two cats named Myles and Sherman. I am very friendly and love to help others, as it helps me to learn a lot and it feels good. My goal is to become an amazing programmer; being able to develop web apps, games, and other software that will help people around the world! I believe that with enough practice, I can make those dreams come true. Thank you for visiting my portfolio page! Don't forget to check out my social media at the bottom of the page! I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">I was born on October 18, 1993 in St Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, BC. I grew up with a fascination with drawing and cartoons, and was heavily inspired by Dav Pikey's 'Captain Underpants' book series. By grade two, I was creating and distributing my own hand-drawn comic books to my classmates as a result of the inspiration that came from those books. Soon afterwards I discovered video games, and loved how they could tell a story with interaction built in. I was immediately fascinated and became a gamer at the young age of 5 years old. At the time, I could only play consoles like the NES, and Sega Genesis at my friends' houses, but by the time I was 6, I was given my first console; the Nintendo 64.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Since then, I have grown up loving games more and more, and over time, became a competitive gamer. I have attended tournaments for the popular title, Super Smash Bros. Melee across North America including Evolution 2013 in Las Vegas, Gameclucks in Seattle, Washington, and various local tournaments in my own hometown of Vancouver, BC. As a gamer, I soon became enthralled with the idea of creating my own games, and have been studying how to do this on-and-off in my free time with the Unity Engine in C#. </p>
                    <p class="card-text">I soon found that creating games was no easy task, and so I enrolled in object oriented programming classes at BCIT. I was introduced to concepts I had never seen before, and it challenged me greatly, but was still able to pass my course. I was in the middle of taking the next course when COVID-19 had become rampant across the world. I had to stop attending class for that reason, and it gave me some time to re-evaluate my situation. I needed to get my foot in the door of the programming world and attain a job. With some research, I found that web development was a skill that many employers are looking for, and started to study it using free resources like FreeCodeCamp and various youtube channels. My dad (who has been a C++ software developer for over 30 years) had just been laid off from his current job, and was looking for a new one. In doing so, he was upgrading his skills to be more marketable, and had come across UofT SCS Full Stack Coding Bootcamp program. He had suggested to me to enroll, and am now currently undergoing this program with the dream of being a web developer once I have graduated. You will find some of my projects on the portfolio page, and you can send me an email using the contact page. Thanks for reading! </p>
